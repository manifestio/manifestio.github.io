							<h3>Working Together</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Manifest is a large group of security veterans who live and work in Austin.  After you reach out and tell us a little about your company, we'll introduce you with a few of our mentors whose skillsets match your current business needs.  In some cases, our mentors may act as cofounders, advisors, consultants, or just a sounding board to meet up with for coffee every few weeks.
